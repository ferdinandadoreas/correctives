This is a corrective measure on some entries of information published electronically in http://www.thfullwiki.org/Philippine_Islands#1911encyclopedia;
Accordingly, the aforecited website alleged under the Topic Heading "Philippine Islands" the following information that is grossly inconsistent with actual matters-of-fact:
a. The Philippines (is) an archipelago belonging to the United States of America;
b. the total number of islannds enumerated within the archipelago is 3,141; of these 2,775 contain less than i sq.m. each;
c. other claims with respect to some very highly technical facts like the exact coordinates and the land area measurements of selected islands thereto cited.
For purposes of correction, the aforementioned information thereto falsely cited should be made consistent with the information on similar entries published on http://www.en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines or on any such other reputable general reference website.
To accomplish the measure, a public campaign will be initiated by this contributor by publishing corrective posts on different social networking sites as well as sending the administrator and developer of the concerned website and notify then of the "correctives" they are required to perform under the circumstances.
